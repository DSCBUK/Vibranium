# CODE OF CONDUCT


All members of the developers student club are required to agree with the following code of conduct. The CoC team will enforce this code throughout the event and we expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody. Details of the CoC are as follows:

- We do not tolerate harassment of the participants in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, tribe, nationality, religion or political views, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

- Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of organizing committee immediately.

- The organizing committee will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe.

- If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizing committee may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the club, or reporting their behavior to local law enforcement.
